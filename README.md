- 🌟 **Write a Letter**: Users could write a letter to another app user, reflecting on memories or sentiments from the past year.  
- 🎆 **Time Capsule**: Letters remained hidden until the New Year, creating a sense of anticipation and excitement.  
- 🎵 **Add Music**: Users could attach a Spotify track to their letters, adding a soundtrack to their sentiments.
